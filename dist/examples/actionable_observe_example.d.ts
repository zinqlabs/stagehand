/**
 * This example shows how to use actionable observe()
 *
 * You can use observe to get a cache-able Playwright action as JSON, then pass that JSON to act() to perform the action.
 *
 * This is useful for:
 * - Previewing actions before running them
 * - Saving actions to a file and replaying them later
 * - Hiding sensitive information from LLMs
 *
 * For more on caching, see: https://docs.stagehand.dev/examples/caching
 * Also check out the form_filling_sensible.ts example for a more complex example of using observe() to fill out a form.
