`extract()` grabs structured text from the current page using structured schemas. Given instructions and `schema`, you will receive structured data.

<Note>
For TypeScript, the extract schemas are defined using zod schemas.

For Python, the extract schemas are defined using pydantic models.
</Note>

### Extract a single object

Here is how an `extract` call might look for a single object:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
const item = await page.extract({
  instruction: "extract the price of the item",
  schema: z.object({
    price: z.number(),
  }),
});
```

```python Python
class Extraction(BaseModel):
    price: float

item = await page.extract(
    "extract the price of the item", 
    schema=Extraction
)
```
</CodeGroup>

Your output schema will look like:
```
{ price: number }
```

### Extract a link
<Note>To extract links or URLs, specify this clearly in your instruction. See the snippet below. </Note>

Here is how an `extract` call might look for extracting a link or URL.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
const extraction = await page.extract({
  instruction: "extract the link to the 'contact us' page",
  schema: z.object({
    link: z.string().url(),
  }),
});

console.log("the link to the contact us page is: ", extraction.link);
```

```python Python
class Extraction(BaseModel):
    link: HttpUrl

extraction = await page.extract(
    "extract the link to the 'contact us' page", 
    schema=Extraction
)

print("the link to the contact us page is: ", extraction.link)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Extract a list of objects

Here is how an `extract` call might look for a list of objects.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
const apartments = await page.extract({
  instruction:
    "Extract ALL the apartment listings and their details, including address, price, and square feet."
  schema: z.object({
    list_of_apartments: z.array(
      z.object({
        address: z.string(),
        price: z.string(),
        square_feet: z.string(),
      }),
    ),
  })
})

console.log("the apartment list is: ", apartments);
```

```python Python
class Apartment(BaseModel):
    address: str
    price: str
    square_feet: str

class Apartments(BaseModel):
    list_of_apartments: list[Apartment]

apartments = await page.extract(
    "Extract ALL the apartment listings and their details as a list, including address, price, and square feet for each apartment",
    schema=Apartments
)

print("the apartment list is: ", apartments)
```
</CodeGroup>

Your output schema will look like:
```
list_of_apartments: [
    {
      address: "street address here",
      price: "$1234.00",
      square_feet: "700"
    },
    {
        address: "another address here",
        price: "1010.00",
        square_feet: "500"
    },
    .
    .
    .
]
```


### Extract with additional context

You can provide additional context to your schema to help the model extract the data more accurately.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
const apartments = await page.extract({
 instruction:
   "Extract ALL the apartment listings and their details, including address, price, and square feet."
 schema: z.object({
   list_of_apartments: z.array(
     z.object({
       address: z.string().describe("the address of the apartment"),
       price: z.string().describe("the price of the apartment"),
       square_feet: z.string().describe("the square footage of the apartment"),
     }),
   ),
 })
})
```

```python Python
class Apartment(BaseModel):
    address: str = Field(..., description="the address of the apartment")
    price: str = Field(..., description="the price of the apartment")
    square_feet: str = Field(..., description="the square footage of the apartment")

class Apartments(BaseModel):
    list_of_apartments: list[Apartment]

apartments = await page.extract(
    "Extract ALL the apartment listings and their details as a list. For each apartment, include: the address of the apartment, the price of the apartment, and the square footage of the apartment",
    schema=Apartments
)
```

### **Arguments:** [`ExtractOptions<T extends z.AnyZodObject>`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/blob/main/types/stagehand.ts)

  <ParamField path="instruction" type="string" required>
    Provides instructions for extraction
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="schema" type="z.AnyZodObject" required>
    Defines the structure of the data to extract (TypeScript only)
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="iframes" type="boolean" optional>
      Set `iframes: true` if the extraction content exists within an iframe.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="useTextExtract" type="boolean" deprecated>
    This field is now **deprecated** and has no effect.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="selector" type="string" optional>
      An xpath that can be used to reduce the scope of an extraction. If an xpath is passed in, `extract` will only process

      accuracy.

    Specifies the model to use
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="modelClientOptions" type="object" optional>
